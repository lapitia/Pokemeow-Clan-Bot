# Pokemeow-Clan-Bot
Helpful bot for a Pokemeow Clan

Adjust the config constants at the top of the file to match your server: ROLE_NAME (clan role), MOD_ROLE_NAME, BOT_ROLES, CATEGORY_NAME, TRACKER_CHANNEL_NAME, TRACKER_CATEGORY_NAME, LEAVE_CHANNEL_ID, TREASURY_ID, and IGNORED_USER_IDS.​

Make sure the tracker channel contains messages from the helper bot that include the GOAL_TEXT string so weekly goal detection works.​

Optionally change TIMEZONE and RESET_TIME for your weekly reset in weekly_reset and the Thursday reminder time in thursday_fee_reminder.
